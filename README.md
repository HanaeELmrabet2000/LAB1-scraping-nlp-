# LAB1-scraping-nlp-
The main purpose behind this lab is to get familiar with Scraping and NLP Pipeline.



During this lab, we delved into web scraping techniques using Beautiful Soup to extract data from the Arabic cooking website Fatafeat. Next, we stored the raw data in a NoSQL database, MongoDB. Following that, we established a Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipeline, which included text cleaning, tokenization, stop words removal, and normalization. Additionally, we explored stemming and lemmatization techniques to analyze their effectiveness. Then, we applied both rule-based and machine learning approaches for Parts of Speech (POS) tagging. Finally, we implemented Named Entity Recognition (NER) methods to identify and classify named entities in the text data. Through these steps, we gained hands-on experience in web scraping, data storage, and various NLP techniques tailored to Arabic text processing.
